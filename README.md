# pi-devin

A [Pi](https://pi.dev) package that uses **Devin Local** models inside Pi.

Pi stays the harness. The [Devin CLI](https://docs.devin.ai/cli) owns login and the live model catalog (`devin auth`, `devin models list`). This is not an ACP integration and does not use Zed.

## Why this exists

`pi-devin-auth` treated Devin as Cascade cloud chat. Models like Sol High, Opus 5, and Fable 5 then failed with:

```text
This model is only in Devin Local.
```

Those models are available through the local Devin CLI. This package uses that CLI for auth + catalog, then streams completions into Pi so Pi's tools, sessions, and UI stay in charge.

## Requirements

- Pi Coding Agent 0.80+
- A signed-in [Devin CLI](https://docs.devin.ai/cli) (`devin auth status`)
- Node 18+

The CLI binary is resolved in this order:

1. `$DEVIN_CLI`
2. `~/.local/bin/devin`, Homebrew, `/usr/local/bin/devin`
3. Devin.app's bundled `devin` binary
4. `which devin`

## Install

From git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/kashyab12/pi-devin
```

After npm publish:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-devin
```

Local checkout:

```bash
pi install /Users/kashyab/pi-devin
```

Restart Pi or run `/reload`.

## Usage

```text
/login devin
/model devin/claude-opus-5-high
/model devin/claude-5-fable-high
/model devin/gpt-5-6-sol-high
```

`/login devin` runs `devin auth login` if `~/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml` is missing. If you already signed in through the Devin CLI or Devin Desktop, that file is reused.

Commands:

- `/devin-status` — CLI path, version, auth
- `/devin-refresh` — reload the model catalog

The last successful CLI catalog is cached at `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/devin/models.json` (default: `~/.pi/agent/devin/models.json`). If the CLI is later unavailable, pi-devin loads that cache. Populate it once while the CLI is installed by restarting Pi or running `/devin-refresh`; a missing or corrupt cache falls back to the bundled models.

## What this is / is not

| This package | Not this package |
|---|---|
| Pi is the agent | Devin taking over the session |
| Devin CLI for auth + catalog | Fake Windsurf OAuth paste flow |
| Live CLI families (Opus 5, Fable 5, Sol, …) | Hardcoded 11-model cloud allowlist |
| Completions streamed into Pi tools | An editor host for Devin |

## Publish

This is a standard Pi package (`keywords: ["pi-package"]` + `pi.extensions`). After you push to npm with that keyword, it can show up on [pi.dev/packages](https://pi.dev/packages).
